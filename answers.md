1. What is the difference between new and create for a model?
For a model, both new and create instatiate and initalize a model. The differences is that new does not save that model, you have to actually run save, while create will automatically save within the database. 

2. What command combined with new will emulate the same behavior as create?
save

3. What is the column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?
timestamps 

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "hat" in the database?
cat = Cat.create name: "hat"

5. What was the most confusing part over the last few weeks?
keeping track of what file to edit, and really understanding the concepts well from each week because they build on each other. I had to go back and review week 2 homework to do the last part of this hw

6. How did you like this homework in comparison with the others?
Yes, it was easier to trouble shoot errors on my own because of the links to the Ruby guide provided in the hw. Also the live coding in lecture helped because I could go back and refer to that.
